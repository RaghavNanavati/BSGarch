# BSGarch
  A model designed to integrate the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity(GARCH) volatility model in the Black-Scholes-Merton model to gain an estimate of American options. the BSM model is known to be a valid estimator in calculating options pricing. However it has two assumptions: the option is European and the volatility is constant(which we know is never the case). The purpose of the model I created is to tweak the BSM model a little to provide a better estimate of American options by incorporating a volatility model like GARCH in it. Attached is the file along with all the instructions step by step.
